// Classes

/*

For this section, we'll be building basic moving game entities 
inspired by the "mobs" in the game Minecraft. We'll call ours "emobs".
We'll have four types of emobs: passive, neutral, hostile.
Each of our emobs has these attributes:
* health -> health of the emob
* awarenessRadius -> how close (in blocks) a player must be for the emob to detect them
* detectionAction -> action the emob takes when it detects a player
* hurtAction -> action the emob takes when it is hurt

Create classes for these emobs following the attributes described in each section:

/* 

Passive emobs:
* health: 10
* awarenessRadius: 16
* detectionAction: "nothing"
* hurtAction of "run_away_randomly"
